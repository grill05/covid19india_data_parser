This python file contains some python functions that run a bunch of different analyses on Indian covid data

To get started, you need to have the python language installed on your system

------------
Further, some additional python packages are necessary. They can be installed via

pip3 install tqdm,lazy_import,pylab,requests,numpy,pandas,colorama

------------
Getting raw data files:

the function update_data_files(extra=True) downloads the necessary data from covid19india.org and google (mobility)

------------

Useful functions:


- analysis() produces cases vs tpr,cases vs deaths,tpr vs tests, and (where available) tpr vs fraction of rapid antigen tests

- plot2() produces a graph of two time series against on left/right axes. Its useful to see correlation (or lack of it) b/w time-series

- analysis_undercounting() generates a plot of hospital/ICU/ventilator beds used vs deaths/tpr (for states where data is available)

- delhi_analysis() is a similar function specifically for delhi (uses parsed data from csv_dumps)

- delhi_sir_reinfection() runs a SIR model that uses mobility/vaccination/genomic data, and estimated reinfection rates to refine its output
  parameters:
    init_date=start date for simulation (when alpha is first introduced)
    delta_intro_date=date when delta is first introduced 
    x_intro_date=date when Variant X is first introduced    
    sim_end_date=end of simulation    
    intro_value_b1=Initial number of B.1 infections    
    intro_value_alpha=Initial number of alpha infections    
    intro_value_delta=Initial number of delta infections    
    intro_value_x=Initial number of Variant X infections    
    R0b/R0a/R0d/R0x: R0 for variants B.1/alpha/delta/X repspectively
    sigma=fraction of those recovered with B.1/alpha who are susceptible to reinfection with delta
    theta=fraction of those recovered with B.1/alpha/delta who are susceptible to reinfection with variant X
    init_prev=Initial population immunity (at t=0)
    population=population of sim region
    vaccine_efficacy=Efficacy of vaccine against transmission
    vaccination_growth_rate=percentage of population vaccinated each day (after last day when cowin data is available)
    state=Delhi/UT etc
    

- get_cases() returns cases/deaths/tests for a particular state

- get_cases_national() same at all-India level 

- get_cases_global() similarly returns cases/deaths/tests for a particular country (using OurWorldinData raw csv file)

- get_mobility() returns mobility change from baseline (per category, average) for district/state/all-India. Optionally, it can generate graphs of those series too

- get_positivity() returns TPR (raw value or 7-day MA) by state or nationally

- parse_census() used stored 2011 census to return various metrics (mean age/gender ratio etc) for each state in 2011

- rweekly() uses n-day ('n' can be specified) percent change in cases/TPR to roughly estimate the R value for a particular country/India/state/district. Optionally generates graphs of that too

- vaccination_national_csv() returns time series of individuals/total doses/males/females/18-45/over 60/HCWs etc vaccinated nationally

- vaccination_cowin_state() returns the same by state (however, recently covid19indiaorg raw state-wise data has had errors)
